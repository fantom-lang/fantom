** SqlConnPool manages a pool of reusable SQL connections

  ** Connection URI
  const Str uri

  ** Connection username

  ** Max number of simultaneous connections to allow before blocking threads
  const Int maxConns := 100

  ** Max time to block waiting for a connection before raising TimeoutErr
  const Duration timeout := 30sec

  ** Time to linger an idle connection before closing it.  An external
  ** actor must call checkLinger periodically to close idle connetions.
  const Duration linger := 5min

  ** onOpen is invoked just after a connection is opened by the pool. This
  ** method can be used to modify the newly opened connection, for example by
  ** turning off autoCommit.

  ** onClose is invoked just before a connection is closed by the pool.

  ** for example by closing prepared Statements that are stored in the
  ** connection's stash.

  ** Allocate a SQL connection inside the given callback.  If a connection
  ** cannot be acquired before `timeout` elapses then a TimeoutErr is raised.
  ** Do not close the connection inside the callback.

  ** Return if `close` has been called.

  ** Return debug dump string for current state
