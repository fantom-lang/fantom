  ** Window mode defines the modal state of the window:

  **   - windowModal: input is blocked to parent window
  **   - appModal: input is blocked to all other windows of application
  **   - sysModal: input is blocked to all windows of all applications
  ** The default is appModel for Dialogs and modeless for all other
  ** window types.  This field cannot be changed once the window
  ** is constructed.

  ** Show all normal window decorations, such as the titlebar, and
  ** frame border.  If false, only the window content will be visible.

  ** passed to the `close` method (typically the Command).  Return
  ** null if canceled or closed without a result.
  **
  ** If the windows has not had its size explicitly set, then it
  ** is packed to use its preferred size.  If the position is
  ** not explicitly set, then the windows is centered over its
  ** parent window (or primary monitor if no parent).
