***********************
Try these links to learn more about Fantom:
  - `Tour`: quick introduction to Fantom's features by code example
  - `WhyFantom`: why we're crazy enough to build Fantom
  - Hello world five different ways:
      - [Fantom shell]`HelloWorld#fansh`: interactive shell
      - [Fantom script]`HelloWorld#script`: executable scripts
      - [Fantom pod]`HelloWorld#pod`: precompiled modules
      - [Fantom fwt]`HelloWorld#fwt`: desktop application
      - [Fantom web app]`HelloWorld#webapp`: web application libraries

Quick Start [#quickStart]
*************************
If you want to jump right in and start coding:

  - [Download]`http://fantom.org` the latest build
  - [Setup]`docTools::Setup`: your environment
  - `HelloWorld`: try your hand at hello world
  - [Examples]`examples::index`: snippets of example
    code for common tasks

Documentation Organization [#organization]
******************************************
All documentation and APIs are organized into modules called *pods*.
The doc index is organized by *manuals* and *APIs*.  APIs are the
reference documentation for each public type generated from source (like
Javadoc).  Manuals group a set of chapters on a subject:

  - [docIntro]`docIntro::index`: general purpose introductory material
  - [docLang]`docLang::index`: covers the language in depth
  - [docTools]`docTools::index`: command line tools, unit testing, build toolkit

In addition [examples]`examples::index` can be accessed as HTML.
All examples are designed as complete stand alone programs which
can be run as a script.

Learning Fantom [#learningFantom]
*********************************
If you want to dig deep, then you'll probably want to look over
[docIntro]`docIntro::index` to get a background.  At some point you
should consider reading [docLang]`docLang::index` front to back - it is
designed to be read as book.  Once you start writing code, you'll
find [examples]`examples::index` and the reference APIs handy as
you learn the standard libraries.  When you start to develop real applications
make sure to review how to write [unit tests]`docTools::Fant` and
[build scripts]`docTools::Build`.

Getting Involved [#gettingInvolved]

[discussion group]`http://fantom.org/sidewalk/topic/`.
