Didn't this language used to be called Fan? [#fan]
**************************************************
Yeap!  Originally the language was called Fan; named after "The Fan" which
is the [neighborhood]`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_district`
where we live in Richmond, VA.  It's a great turn of the 20th century
neighborhood back when urban planning was human-centric as opposed
to automobile-centric.  But after a long debate about the searchability
of Fan, we renamed the language to Fantom in November 2009.
