Overview [#overview]
********************
Flux is a framework for building general purpose desktop applications
with the [fwt]`docLib::Fwt` toolkit.  This chapter covers how to use
the flux APIs for creating new applications and plugins. See
[docTools]`docTools::Flux` for how to setup and use flux as an IDE.

Flux is based on a browser navigation model.  Users navigate
Uris which are resolved to *resources*.  Users interact with
resources through *views* which are used to view and edit the resources.
The next sections cover *resources* and *views* in detail.

The Flux chrome works very much like a traditional browser.  It
handles navigation, history, and view tabs.  It provides a plugin
model for adding sidebars which are used independently of views.

Resources [#resources]
**********************
Resources are the objects a user browses, views, and edits in a flux
application.  Resources are modeled by the `flux::Resource` class.
The 'Resource' class typically wraps some other Fan object to define
how it is presented in the user interface such as its name, icon,
the available views, and children if tree structured.

The most common resource is [FileResource]`flux::FileResource` which
is used to wrap a `sys::File` instance.  FileResource uses MIME type
to map files to their icon and available views.

Views [#views]
**************
Views are user interface components which subclass from `fwt::ContentPane`.
A view is how a user interacts with a resource for visualizing and/or editing.
Views are model by the `flux::View` class.

View Lifecycle [#viewLifecycle]
===============================
The view lifecycle typically involves these steps:
  1. **Construction**: when your view's constructor is called you
     don't have access to the parent frame or resource; so typically
     you won't do much in your constructor.
  2. **onLoad**: the 'onLoad' callback is invoked when the view
     should load its UI state from the resource.  At this point
     both [View.frame]`flux::View.frame` and [View.resource]`flux::View.resource`
     are available.  However your view has not been mounted into the
     into the widget tree yet.
  3. **dirty**: if your view is an editor, then you should set the
     [dirty]`flux::View.dirty` field to true when the user makes a modification
     to the resource.
  4. **onSave**: the framework will determine when the user wishes
     to save your view.  This might happen from the Save or Save All
     commands, or might occur from a close prompt.  The view should save
     the UI state back to the actual resource - for example if editing a
     file, then the view will rewrite the file.  Once 'onSave' completes,
     the dirty flag is set back to false.
  5. **onUnload**: this callback is invoked when the view is being unloaded,
     typically because navigating to a new resource or view.

In addition to the above, views receive the 'onActive' and
'onInactive' callbacks when the view is selected and unselected
as the active tab.  The 'onActive' callback is used to enable
predefined view managed commands such as find and replace.

Navigation [#navigation]
************************
When a user navigates to a Uri, the flux runtime performs the following
process to resolve the resource and views:

Uri Resolution [#uriResolution]
===============================
The step of navigation is to resolve the Uri to a normal Fan 'Obj' using
the standard [naming facilities]`docLang::Naming`.  This means that
any Uri which has been mapped via a 'UriScheme' or into the
[UriSpace API]`docLang::UriSpaces` is available for navigation.  You
can plug application specific resources into flux using either of
these techniques.

Resource Resolution [#resourceResolution]
=========================================
Uri resolution maps the Uri to a normal Fan object. But we really want
a 'Resource' instance so that we know how to display the object in our UI.
If the object from uri resolution is already an instance of Resource, then
we don't need to do anything special.

If the object from uri resolution is not a Resource, then we search the
type database for a Resource keyed by the '@fluxResource' facet for
the object's type.  The 'FileResource' class is automatically registered
to handle 'sys::File'.  For example to map an instance of 'AppRecord' to
'AppResource':

  @fluxResource=AppRecord#
  class AppResource : Resource
  {
    new (Uri uri, AppRecord rec) { this.uri = uri; this.rec = rec }
    override Uri uri
    override Str name() { ... }
    override Image icon() { ... }
    AppRecord rec
  }

If you map a Resource subclass using the '@fluxResource' facet,
then you need to ensure that your 'make' constructor takes Uri as its
first parameter, and the mapped object as its second parameter.

View Resolution [#viewResolution]
=================================
Once we've resolved the uri to a resource instance, the next step is
to discover which views are available to view and edit the resource.
The list of available views is deferred to the [Resource.views]`flux::Resource.views`
method.  The first view in the list should be default view.

The default strategy for resolving views by 'Resource.views' is to
query the type database for any 'View' keyed by the '@fluxView' facet on
the resource's type.  For example to register 'AppView' on 'AppResource':

  @fluxView=AppResource#
  class AppView : View
  {
    override Void onLoad() { ... }
  }

If working with files, then you typically register a view
[by MIME type]`flux::FileResource.views`:

  // register on text/*
  @fluxViewMimeType="text"
  internal class MyTextView : View

  // register on text/xml
  @fluxViewMimeType="text/xml"
  internal class MyXmlView : View

  // register on multiple MIME types
  @fluxViewMimeType=["text/xml", "text/html"]
  internal class MyHtmlView : View

View Query [#viewQuery]
=======================
The default view used to work with a resource is the first view in
the list returned by 'Resource.views'.  Alternate views are selected
in the Uri's query map with a 'view' key and qualified view typename
as the value:

  file:/home/file.txt?view=fluxText::TextEditor

Typically the flux chrome will handle displaying the list of available
views and allowing the user to choose alternate views.

SideBars [#sideBars]
********************
A `flux::SideBar` is a plugin which exists independent of resources
and views.  Sidebars are widgets which may be opened along the left,
bottom, or right edges of the view pane.  SideBars are registered
with the '@fluxSideBar' facet.  A very simple sidebar:

  @fluxSideBar
  class ExampleSideBar : SideBar
  {
    new make() { content = Label {"Example SideBar" } }
  }

There is one instance of a SideBar per registered type for each Frame.
The SideBar is instantiated in memory the first time the user shows it
within a given frame.  After that the instance is mounted and unmounted
from the frame using [show]`flux::SideBar.show` and [hide]`flux::SideBar.hide`.

Typically the user manages the sidebars via the View menu.  The id for
each sidebar command on the View menu is that SideBar's type name, and
localization is based on the type's pod.  You can setup icons and
accelerators using the normal conventions via localization.

SideBars receive a set of callbacks to manage their lifecycle and
respond to view selections:
  - **onLoad**: called when loaded into memory; good place to load
    persistent state
  - **onUnload**: called when unloaded from memory; good place to save
    persistent state
  - **onShow**: called when shown on frame
  - **onHide**: called when hidden on frame
  - **onActive**: called when user links to new resource or selects new tab
  - **onInactive**: called when current view is replaced with new view or tab
