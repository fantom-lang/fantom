# Fantom Programming Language

Fantom is a portable language that runs on the JVM and modern web browsers. It
features a familiar Java-like syntax, static (and dynamic) typing, elegant
system library, closures, immutability, actor concurrency, and much more.

```fantom
// Hello from Fantom!
class HelloWorld
{
  static Void main()
  {
    echo("Hello, World!")
  }
}
```
